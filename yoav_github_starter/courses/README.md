# Courses

Each course gets a folder: `course-name` or `code-name`.

Suggested inner structure:
- `assignments/` — numbered folders (`hw01`, `hw02`) each with a README explaining the solution
- `notes.md` — concise study notes
- `exam-prep.md` — formulas, pitfalls, links

Minimum README per assignment:
```markdown
# HW01 — Problem Title
- Language/Stack: Python 3.11
- How to run: `python main.py`
- Complexity: O(n log n) time, O(n) space
- Tests: `pytest`
- Reflection: what I learned, what I'd improve
