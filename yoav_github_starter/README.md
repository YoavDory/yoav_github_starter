# Yoav Dory — CS & Entrepreneurship

This repo is a **starter portfolio** to organize coursework, projects, experiments and docs.

## Structure
- `courses/` — per-course folders with assignments and notes
- `projects/` — personal and course projects with their own READMEs
- `playground/` — quick experiments, spikes, throwaway code
- `docs/` — notes, design docs, diagrams
- `templates/` — issue/PR templates, README snippets, licensing

> Tip: keep commits small, messages clear, and ship something weekly.
